## Information about the CTF
There is a website running at https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/39720/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:39720. Do you think you can log us in? Try to see if you can login!

## How to solve it
Interacting with the website, we can see that we can login using a username and password. The support page shows that an user has gotten an SQL error, indicating the website is prone to SQL injection.

Lets try to login using the username `' OR 1=1--` and a random password. 

Aaaand we are in and we can see the flag.

The SQL query might therefore have looked like this:

```sql
SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username='$username' AND password='$password';
```

Where our provided username made the query look like this:

```sql
SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username='' OR 1=1--' AND password='';
```

Which evaluates to `true` and therefore bypasses everything else.
