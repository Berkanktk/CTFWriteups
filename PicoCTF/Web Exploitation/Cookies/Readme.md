## Information about the CTF
Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one. http://mercury.picoctf.net:54219/

## How to solve it
Go to the website and check the cookies.

This shows that there is a cookie called `name` and it's value is `-1`. Let's change it to `1` and refresh the page.

Welp, that did something, but we didn't get the flag. 

Lets make a script to enumerate some possible values
```bash
#!/bin/bash

for i in {0..50}
do
    echo "$i"
    curl -b name=$i http://mercury.picoctf.net:54219/check 2>/dev/null | grep -oI '\S*picoCTF\S*'
done

# ..
# 17
# 18
# <code>picoCTF{flag_is_shown_here}</code></p>
# 19
# 20
```
Tadaaa
