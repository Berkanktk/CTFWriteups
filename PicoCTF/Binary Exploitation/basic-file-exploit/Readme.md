# Basic File Exploit
The program provided allows you to write to a file and read what you wrote from it. Try playing around with it and see if you can break it!
Connect to the program with netcat:
$ `nc saturn.picoctf.net 65317`


## Solution
When looking at the code a particular block of code caught my attention:

```c
static void data_read() {
  ...
  if ((entry_number = strtol(entry, NULL, 10)) == 0) {
    puts(flag);
    fseek(stdin, 0, SEEK_END);
    exit(0);
  }
...
```
Here inside the `data_read()` function, the program checks if the `entry_number` is equal to 0. If it is, then the program prints the flag and exits.

So i tried that:
```bash
$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 65317
